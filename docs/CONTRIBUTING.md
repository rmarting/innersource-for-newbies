## Code of Conduct

This project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). All participants are expected to
uphold this code. Violations of the code can be reported by contacting us in by [Communication Channels](./CONTACT.md).

## How to contribute

To go to repository, simply click on Github Cat icon on upper right corner:

![GitHub Cat](./images/github-cat.png 'GitHub Cat')

Fork the repo, create a local branch, add or change files, and create a pull request. You can make these changes
via the git web interface, the command line, or a git client of your choice.

Once you create a pull request, we will review and provide feedback, but it might take me some
time to comment, review, or merge it.

### Before you contribute

To contribute, use Pull Requests, from your own **fork**.

Also, make sure you have set up your Git authorship correctly:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

We use this information to acknowledge your contributions in release announcements.

### Pull Request Process

To integrate changes into the stable branches of the product must be done by a pull request process:

* Create a new branch (🎏 Tip: add the issue number can help to track it)
* Add your changes and commit them
* Push commits to the branch.
* Consider whether documentation or tests need to be added or updated as part of the change.
* Verify all tests have passed successfully.
* Open a PR against the target branch of the repository.
  * If the PR is still a work in progress but needs to be pushed to facilitate review, then [convert to draft](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#converting-a-pull-request-to-a-draft).
  * Consider identifying committers who have worked on the code or documentation being changed.
* Add comments with information about the PR.
* During the Review Process you could add more commits in the PR.
* The PR will be approved when:
  * CI pipeline is successful.
  * A committer reviewed and verified it successfully.
* Committers have the quality vote to approve or reject the PR.
* If your PR is rejected, we will give an explanation for the reasoning and close it.
* In general the PR will be integrated as one commit (Squash and Merge) to have a cleaner log history.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, need to be reviewed before being merged.

* Other reviewers, including committers, may comment on the changes and suggest modifications. Changes can
be added by simply pushing more commits to the same branch.
* Please add a comment and `@` the reviewer in the PR if you have addressed reviewers' comments.
* Any conversation must comply with the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) of the community. The outcome
may be a rejection of the entire change.
* Reviewers will typically include the acronym `LGTM` in their approval comment. This is a
convention defined to approve PR before the _approve_ it.
* Sometimes, other changes will be merged which conflict with your PR's changes. The PR cannot
be merged until the conflict is resolved.
* Try to be responsive to the discussion rather than let days pass between replies.

## Gathering Feedback

As a community, we strive to provide kind and constructive feedback on your PR.

If a pull request doesn't meet the _must be_ guidelines, we may ask that the pull request be updated
before it's merged. If a pull request doesn't meet the _should be_ guidelines,
we may merge the pull request and add an issue for future improvements.

Again, thank you so much for your interest and support!

Happy contributing 📝📚👪!!!

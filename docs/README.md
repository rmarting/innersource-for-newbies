## For Newbies like you

This experience targets a **novice learner** (a newbie). This learner has little (if any) background in
fundamental open source principles and practices. But this learner is interested in rethinking the way an
internal team, department, or other organization approaches software development‚Äîperhaps in order to accelerate
the speed of development, reduce complexity, or increase developer job satisfaction. The learner has heard that
adopting something called "**InnerSource**" might be one way to do this, and would like to learn more about
what this entails.

This learner may be asking questions like:

* What is "InnerSource" and how does it relate to "open source"?
* How does practicing InnerSource help my team work differently?
* What benefits would my organization derive from practicing InnerSource?

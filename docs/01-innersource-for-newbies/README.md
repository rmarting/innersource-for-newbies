enthusiasm. So grab a seat, relax, and let's explore together!

Generally speaking, InnerSource is nearly identical to open source software development. The most significant difference
is that, unlike open source development that is done collaboratively across multiple organizations with publicly
accessible materials, an organization using InnerSource is conducting all of their open source-style development within
the confines of that organization.

Within the InnerSource methodology, programmers share their work with a wider audience in their organization, instead of
just within their own team, within the confines of their infrastructure. New code repositories and branches based on
the original project can be made freely, so that teams and departments with unanticipated uses for the code can adapt it.
Communication is written and posted to broader internal channels instead of shared informally by word of mouth, which
reduces organizational siloization, increases collaboration, provides a history of the project, and sets up better
learning opportunities for new project members.

The next sections provide you deeper details about InnerSource, its main principles, and the main collaboration workflows.

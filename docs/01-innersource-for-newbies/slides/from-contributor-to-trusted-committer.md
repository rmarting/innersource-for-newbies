## From Contributor to Trusted Committer

*Next level of your InnerSource Journey*

------

#### What is a Trusted Committer?

> A motivated, active and verified contributor supporting contributions and scaling up the InnerSource project

Note:
The Trusted Committer role is one of the key roles in an InnerSource community.
They are people that the community trust with important technical decisions and with mentoring contributors.

Generally speaking, the Trusted Committer role is defined by its responsibilities, rather than by its privileges.

---

#### Main Responsibilities

- Review and approve contributions (code, documentation, etc.)
- Provide constructive feedback to contributors
- Ensure alignment with project goals and standards
- Responsible for maintaining project quality
- Maintain clear and consistent documentation

Note:
Trusted Committers represent the interests of the InnerSource community and project.
So as a Trusted Committer, you’ll have both tech- and community-oriented responsibilities.

---

#### Behaviors Expected

- Engaged with frequent contributions (code, documentation, features...)
- Experienced on the project and domains managed by the InnerSource community
- Acts as a bridge between contributors and project maintainers

------

#### Why is important the Trusted Committer role?

Support a growth community without modify the core team, just extending it.

Delegation of actions from the Core team improving the final impact and results.

---

#### Keeping the community health

- Ensure the long-term success building a healthy software
- Strike a good balance between enduring product quality and growing a healthy community
- Lead by example
- Maintain and support the Code of Conduct

Note:
What does a healthy community look like? Contributors tend to stick around, can spend most of their time developing software, and are able to level up their abilities.

Trusted Committers should strive to create a welcoming and appreciative environment for their Contributors that allows them to concentrate on writing software and growing personally by creating opportunities to learn from other community members.

---

#### Reducing the barriers to making contributions

* Maintain a good welcome file (e.g: `README.md`)
* Improve the process to get involved or started in the project
* Maintain a good Contribution Guide to help any contributor
* Make sure that onboarding and contributing are positive experiences

Note:
Soliciting contributions in an InnerSource community is more challenging than it is in an Open Source community:

- The sheer number of potential Contributors is lower in InnerSource communities.
- Contributors will want to contribute during their work time, which means they are more time constrained.
- Work in InnerSource might not necessarily be part of Contributors' official performance goals, so time spent working on InnerSource may seem to detract from achieving those goals.

It is super important for InnerSource communities in a corporate environment to keep the barriers to contributing as low as possible to allow as many people as possible to contribute.
That means providing both access to helpful documentation and people in the community to answer any questions and to encourage collaboration.

---

#### Upleveling the community

- Promote the movement from individuals or consumers to contributors
- Communicate opportunities to make contributions
- Elicit and align contributor's interest with the community
- Identify and support contributors with the potential to grow

Note:
As a Trusted Committer, you are responsible for moving individuals along this continuum and upleveling their ability to make contributions. In this sense, Trusted Committers act as force multipliers in their community.

Trusted Committers need to attract new Contributors and level up their ability to make contributions.
This activity ultimately levels up the community’s ability to create better software faster.

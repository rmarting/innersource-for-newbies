## üèÅ Getting Started

This repository was created on top of two amazing frameworks to publish content easily:

* [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) - Building the main content site
* [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) - Presenting professional content

The content of this site is located at [docs](./docs/) folder following the standard configuration of both frameworks.

To start locally your own server and serve the content:

```shell
npm install -g docsify-cli@latest
docsify serve docs
```

The content will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üõà Further information

The content is mostly created using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) syntax, so you do not need
to use HTML, JavaScript or other languages to prepare the content of this site. Easy, right?

**docsify** is used to generate the main structure of the content, including a sidebar with links to the
main sections, and **reveal.js** is used to create slides for some topics linked from the main site. Both
frameworks are integrated creating an unique experience for the reader improving the quality of the learning
and presenting the content easily and usefully for anyone.

Upgrading the frameworks to the latest versions should be done following the official documentation.

## üìç Releases

This project follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) to release
versions of this repository. The [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) file contains a curated,
chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of this project.

Realising a new version only requires to push a new tag following the
`v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+` pattern (e.g: `v0.1.0`, `v0.1.1`...).

The [release-drafter.yml](.github/workflows/release-drafter.yml) workflow is triggered once
the new tag is pushed and create the new release. This workflow is based on the
[Release Drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) GitHub action, automating
the creation of the release, including the update of the Change Log file.

## Publishing content

The content of this repo is designed to be published easily using capabilities as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

In the case those capabilities are not available, there is a [`Containerfile`](./Containerfile)
to build an image and deploy that image as an application in any container orchestrator such
as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or [Red Hat OpenShift](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift/overview).
